# Clean Code Principles for Data Science and Machine Learning
# Task - Cleaning a Dataquest.io's project

The objective of this task is to apply the principles of clean code in a ready-made project, made available by the Dataquest.io platform. For this, we will use some tools such as Pylint and Autopep8, which, as seen in class, help to identify and repair most errors.

The project is called 'Guided Project: Predicting Car Prices' and consists of a python notebook file (.ipynb) containing the modeling of a car price prediction system using k-nearest neighbors algorithm.

## Requirements

Before starting the task, it is necessary to install both pylint and autopep8, this can be done easily using the terminal window and typing the following commands:

```
pip install pylint
```

```
pip install autopep8
```
## Step 1 - Generate the notebook (.ipynb) for the Guided Project

To get the .ipynb file, just access the project link in [Dataquest](https://app.dataquest.io/m/155/guided-project%3A-predicting-car-prices), click on the "solution" tab, then download the file from github, remembering to set the .ipynb extension.

## Step 2 - Validate the file generated in step 1) by executing it

In this step, the Jupyter environment integrated to VSCode was used, through which the notebook cells were executed without problems.
NOTE: You must also download the dataset used in the notebook file. It's important that the data file ("imports-85.data") and the notebook file are in the same repository for the execution to work.

## Step 3 - Generate a script (.py file)

The transformation of the .ipynb file into a .py script was done manually, copying the notebook cells and pasting them into a single .py file

## Step 4 - Evaluate the adherence of clean code best practices executing the pylint command in terminal

In this step, we use pylint to get an assessment, on a scale of 0 to 10m, of the level of organization and best practices that the code has. The first evaluation was done right after transforming the file to .py.

Running the following command in the terminal:

```
pylint initial_guided_project.py
```

A score of 4.7/10 was obtained and a series of good practice errors were listed.

## Step 5 - Refactor the code using best practices and achieve a 10/10 through pylint

Obtaining the list of points to be corrected, we can use the autopep8 tool, which is capable of correcting part of these errors automatically.
Before running autopep8, in order to keep the original file, a copy of "initial_guided_project.py" called "clean_guided_project.py" was created, so that all changes made are in the new file.
Running the following command:

```
autopep8 -i clean_guided_project
```

autopep already makes the changes and overwrites the file. To see if there really was an improvement, we ran pylint again and analyzed the result.

```
pylint clean_guided_project
```

Now we got a 6.67/10, still far from ideal, but with a considerable improvement over the file before using autopep8.

To reach 10/10, the rest of the changes had to be done manually, observing the list of errors generated by pylint and changing the file until the errors were corrected.

In the end, we managed to get the maximum grade and get a clean code, according to the pylint criteria
